About Project:
In our project we used two class "Allstandard" and "Topic" ,aditionally "Weightage" this weightage class is to display the weightage of lessons in each classes.
In "Allstandard" we used 'clsimg' to store the image ,'standardname' to store the name of the class mad 'deskrip' to store the description that is the lessons in that class.
In "Topics" we used 'Topicname' to store the class in which this lesson belong to,'tname' is to store the particular lesson name and 'files' to hold the pdfs.

we even used google authentication and the signin signup process are all are done with "allauth".    

we reduced our lesson number and class number due to lack of storage, forgive us.
